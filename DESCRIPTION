Description: Implementation of hierarchical inference based on Renaux and 
    Bühlmann (2021) 'Efficient Multiple Testing Adjustment for Hierarchical 
    Inference' <arXiv:2104.15028>.  
    The R-package hierbase offers tools to perform hierarchical inference 
    for one or multiple data sets based on ready-to-use (group) test functions
    or alternatively a user specified (group) test function. The procedure 
    is based on an efficient hierarchical multiple testing correction and 
    controls the family-wise error rate (FWER). The functions can easily 
    be run in parallel. 
    Hierarchical inference can be applied to (low- or) high-dimensional 
    data sets to find significant groups or single variables (depending on 
    the signal strength and correlation structure) in a data-driven and 
    automated procedure. Possible applications can for example be found 
    in statistical genetics and statistical genomics.
